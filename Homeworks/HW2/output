The w value does have a significant impact on convergence depending on
the value used for w. There does seem to be a "sweet spot" in which
SOR can lead to quite fast convergence. Also a properly preconditioned
Conjugate-Gradient can converge even faster than SOR. Gauss-Seidel
seems to be a good middle ground between simplicity and ease of use
(i.e. no need to find good 'w' or 'C_inv' values) for the solution to
converge in a timely manner.
