# Description:
# Constructs the continuous least squares trigonometric polynomial
# coefficients of degree n with the given function f (in terms of x)
# and lower and upper bounds a and b. These are nominallly -pi to pi,
# so don't count on this algorithm working for any other bounds. After
# you get the coefficients, its up to you to figure out what to do
# with them (Fourier Series is a good buzz-word suggestion).
