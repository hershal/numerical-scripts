Numerical Analysis Scripts (M368K)

These are a bunch of scripts I used when I was in my Numerical
Analysis class (M368K) at the University of Texas at Austin. The
reason this repository exists is because these scripts seem to be at
least of some use and, since this class was arguably my favorite that
I've taken at UT, I believe that I should keep these up to date.

Over time I will add corrections to my homeworks so that even if I
lose the original documents, I'll still be able to reference their
original (but corrected) versions here.
